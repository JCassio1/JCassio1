### Hey, It's Joselson Dias here 👋
From quality of code to a great user experience. I love experimenting with new technologies and building projects.

- 💻 I work a lot on apps based in Swift/SwiftUI but I quickly switch or learn other languages whenever it is apropriate for certain projects.
- ☀️ Learning and Developing complex SwiftUI apps with deep focus on user experience and design.
- 💬 Ask me about software, digital marketing and any other topic.
- ✍️ Writing tech blog posts over Internet.
- 😄 I deeply recommend listening to music while coding
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a page on instagram about [Cyber-security](https://www.instagram.com/codigo.qr.ao/) and love to create dishes with elaborate preparations and presented aesthetically.
